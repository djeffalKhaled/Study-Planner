# Study-Planner
This is a windows application written in c#. It is my way of how one should organise their school studies, and if you do not plan your studying, u are dummy dummy. It utilises a week based system which starts by the first sunday and ends by the last sunday of the month, and yes in my culture sunday is the first day of the week (IMPOSSIBLE!!111!1). The calculations of the week system also reach week 5 haha (UNSCIENTIFIC!!ยง/:1ยง1). This is a cool app yes yes and it took me 9 hours to program it and design, it was quite a lot of fun.

The D section represents the day of the week. The study section is for your subjects, You'd put the hours you spent studying them. The gain section is what exactly you studied, no need to provide a lot of info just a basic title.

This is the place for writing your pesky life each week, don't mind the text!
# Save and Load System:

The great and mighty save and loader! It saves your depressing life! This uses c#'s file IO system because of how low cost in memory it is (definitely not because I'm too lazy to write a database).

# How to download: 
Click on the bin folder than keep clicking till you view the .exe file, run it, and here you go! If windows security screams at you don't worry, I simply haven't bothered to fill in any information about who made this file thus usually windows would find it sus. You can also run this on visual studio easily.
